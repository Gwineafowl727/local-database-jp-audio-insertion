to do:
-make sure it works on mac cuz god knows if i did the os module stuff right
-implement cross checking with kana fields to eliminate wrong audios from getting added
-make it possible to convert katakana words to hiragana so that they can be found (i.e. ヘラヘラ)
-make it possible to prefer nhk/shinmeikai only when multiple pitches are found, otherwise prefer other things
